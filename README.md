# Hi, I'm Zach ðŸ‘‹
I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. I thrive on learning and sharing new technologies.

Right now, I'm at Neo4j, where I get to work on cool projects with GenAI and graph databases. Whether it's developing coded examples, creating demo apps, writing blogs, supporting sales & solutions, or delivering technical presentations, I love sharing knowledge and helping others leverage these tools.

Off the clock, you'll find me tinkering with new projects, staying updated on the latest AI trends, or trying to stay young by lifting progressively heavier things (powerlifting). Feel free to check out my projects below or connect with me if you want to chat!

## Technical Project Highlights

### AI, Agents, and Retrieval

#### Software Dev & Research
- __Graph-ND (Knowledge in Graphs, not Documents)__ - a new Python project for building end-to-end GraphRAG systems with a simple, intuitive API: [code](https://github.com/zach-blumenfeld/graph-nd)
- __Boosting Q&A accuracy__ with __graph DBs__ & graph neural networks (__GNNs__) + LLM fine-tuning with __G-Retriever__:
   - [NVIDIA blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/boosting-qa-accuracy-with-graphrag-using-pyg-and-graph-databases/)
   - [code](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/neo4j-gnn-llm-example)

#### Applied Examples
- __Agentic AI for supply chain & bill of materials__ - Supplier substitution search, country & trade dependency analytics for complex BOMs with mixed intel, parts search and comparisons, etc. End-to-end example with deployment on GCP: [code](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/neo4j-supplier-graph) 
- __Agentic AI for customer & retail analytics__ leverages mixed data with GraphRAG. End-to-end example from data loading, to designing retrieval tools, and building an agent: [dev guide](https://neo4j.com/developer/genai-ecosystem/customer-graph-agent/) & [code](https://github.com/neo4j-product-examples/graphrag-examples/tree/main/customer-graph)
