# Hi, I'm Zach ðŸ‘‹
I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. I thrive on learning and sharing new technologies.

Right now, I'm at Neo4j, where I get to work on cool projects with GenAI and graph databases. Whether it's developing coded examples, creating demo apps, writing blogs, supporting sales & solutions, or delivering technical presentations, I love sharing knowledge and helping others leverage these tools.

Off the clock, you'll find me tinkering with new projects, staying updated on the latest AI trends, or trying to stay young by lifting progressively heavier things (powerlifting). Feel free to check out my projects below or connect with me if you want to chat!

## Technical Project Highlights
